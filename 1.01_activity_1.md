Try to answer these questions:

1. What is the difference between list and tuple?
   the list are mutable, you can edit, and list are enclosed in square brackets but the tuple are inmutable and are enclosed between pareentheses
3. What is the difference between `for` loop and `while` loop?
   for loops are used when you want to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or any object that supports iteration and is determined by the length of the sequence being iterated over
   and while is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true
5. What are the conditional statements in Python?
   the conditional statements can be combined in various ways to create more complex decision-making structures in your code. there are three types of conditionals: if, else, and elif (else if).
